# Sock Shop

This project was created for AC32006 (Database systems). The assignment was to create a shop that allows people to use the store online as well as allow staff to moderate stock levels. We decided our niche was socks. To see this site working visit https://zeno.computing.dundee.ac.uk/2017-ac32006/team19

## Getting Started

To deploy this simple put your database details into the db.php file and host the directory using your chosen hosing software.

## Next Steps ##

There are many next steps to this project but some of the biggest improvements that could be made in the future are:
* Make the website secure
  * Fix plain text password
  * Fix XSS vulnerabilities
  * Fix SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
* Add a payment system
